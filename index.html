				<h2 id="tribute-title">Background</h2>

				<p>
					Bardin is a Ranger of the Grey Mountains, keeping the holds of Karak
					Ziflin and Karak Norn safe from overground attacks. Rangers rove far
					and wide, always on the lookout for enemy activity. It was on one such
					expedition that Bardin came across an abandoned mine entrance. The
					mine was clearly Dwarf in origin but, having spent countless decades
					ranging across the Grey Mountains, it was not one Bardin was familiar
					with. The mine entrance must have been hidden until recently, perhaps
					revealed by a rock slide.
				</p>

				<p>
					Without a moment’s thought Goreksson entered, only pausing to bring
					out his trusty axe. The mine itself was much as he expected – long
					since exhausted of any precious ore. Further in, the Ranger came
					across something of interest, four Dwarf bodies clothed in now-rotten
					rags, but rags that may once have suggested a lengthy journey was
					imminent. Next to the Dwarf bodies was a mound of long-dead rats and
					the unmistakable corpse of a Ratman. In its clawed, skeletal hands was
					a small tattered piece of parchment, the Dwarven letters of the
					Klinkarhun inscribed on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Within the backpack of one of the Dwarf dead was another torn piece of
					the same parchment. Bardin put the parts together and discovered, to
					his quickening heart, that he had an ancient map. What excited him so
					was the map’s destination, that of Karak Zorn – the infamous lost hold
					of the Dwarfs that lay hidden somewhere along the Worlds Edge
					Mountains in the Southlands. The map was of limited use though, as
					half the map keys and riddlespeak was in an unfamiliar variant of
					Klinkarhun.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon return, Bardin made several attempts to find funding and
					clan-backing for an exploration party but found he was refused,
					laughed, and scorned at from every Hold in the Grey Mountains, a
					humiliating fact which only steadied his resolve in the matter.
				</p>

				<p>
					He now journeyed to Ubersreik, as word had reached him from the large
					Dwarf community there. It was said a shop of antiquities on the edge
					of the Marktplaz held a large Dwarfish tome. According to the
					rumour-smith he paid honest Dwarf gold to, the book’s page are covered
					in faded runes written in an long-disused version of the Klinkarhun,
					and could very well be the key to understanding the map to the lost
					hold. The Ranger was on his way to purchase this tome, after having
					negotiated a fair price. Of course, what Bardin considers a fair price
					may be very different to the shopkeeper, but the Dwarf's skills of
					negotiating – shouting very loudly until he gets his way – are
					formidable.
